        <h3>Work</h3>
        <h4> Planning</h4>
        <p> The purpose of the work plan is to create a visual reference for the goals, objectives, tasks and team members responsible for each area. Every member of the team should be updated with progress and current status.​
            You can create your own custom work plan. Work plan templates save time as you insert tasks, team members, goals, and timetables.​
            The work plan includes:​Set goals and objectives​ and Set a project schedule​.
            Studying these details carefully before embarking on a large project can determine the responsibilities of team members, reduce the chance of going over budget, and increase the likelihood of achieving goals within the allotted time period.</p>
